# Sequential Experiments
Repository to:
- Create DGP(s) (both A/A and A/B tests)
- Employ different experiment configurations and analysis methods

Implemented:
- Bernoulli type DGP (for proportion tests)
- Fixed-wins, proportion type test (based on the method described [here](https://www.evanmiller.org/sequential-ab-testing.html#cite4))
